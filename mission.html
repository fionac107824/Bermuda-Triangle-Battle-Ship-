	    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
	    <h2>This page details the main mission of our game and our purpose for creating this game.</h2>
	    <p>Our game is inspired by the game “Battleship” that attempts to highlight the issues of misinformations.
		Four players who has blindly listened to conspiracy theories and misinformation hastily made plans to go to the Bermuda 
		Triangle in search of treasure. Upon their arrival, however, they realize that they has inadequately packed for their 
		 journey as they're swept up in a large storm. Now the players must play battleship as a survival of the fittest to see 
		 which player and their ships will survive the storm.</p>
