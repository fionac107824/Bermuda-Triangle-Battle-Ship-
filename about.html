<h2 id="Fiona">Fiona's About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a 17 year old senoir at the Engineering and Science University Magnet School in West Haven, Connecticut.

        <h3>Defintion of Game</h3>
        <p> A game is something that you would do online or physically that has a set of rules for you to follows 
            that you usually play either by yourself or with other people that also gives you entertainment.</p>
        <h3>Gamer Types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>73% Explorer</li>
            <li>60% Achiever</li>
            <li>47% Killer</li>
            <li>20% Socialiser</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Favorite Games</h3>
        <p> My favorite game is Crazy 8s. It is my favorite game because I don't really play another other game besides simple card games. 
            I like how with Crazy 8's you are using your logic to see how you can 
            calculate your moves to get other players out and get rid of all of your cards first.</p>
