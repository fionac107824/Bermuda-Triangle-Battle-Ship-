<h2 id="Fiona">Fiona's About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a 17 year old senoir at the Engineering and Science University Magnet School in West Haven, Connecticut.
            I enjoy reading and economics. This will be my first game creation.</p>
        <h3>Defintion of Game</h3>
        <p> A game is something that you would do online or physically that has a set of rules for you to follows 
            that you usually play either by yourself or with other people that also gives you entertainment.</p>
        <h3>Gamer Types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>73% Explorer</li>
            <li>60% Achiever</li>
            <li>47% Killer</li>
            <li>20% Socialiser</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Favorite Games</h3>
        <p> My favorite game is Crazy 8s. It is my favorite game because I don't really play another other game besides simple card games. 
            I like how with Crazy 8's you are using your logic to see how you can 
            calculate your moves to get other players out and get rid of all of your cards first.</p>

       <p>I am currently a 16 year old junior at the Engineering and Science University Magnet School in West Haven, Connecticut.
           I enjoy playing basketball, playing the game, and hanging out with friends. This will be my first game creation.</p>
       <h3>Definition of Game</h3>

       <h3> Favorite Games</h3>
       <p> My favorite game is NBA 2k. It is my favorite game because I enjoy it almost every time I play, and I really enjoy playing it with my friends .
           I like with NBA 2k you get to go against other real people online and you get to be an NBA player .</p>

 <h2 id="Josh">Josh's About me</h2>   
         <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Joshua Casillas, and I am a 15 year old boy who is a sophomore at ESUMS. This website is meant to document and show my progress throughout the game
           we are making in our multimedia and tech design class. I think I want my game to be some kind of 2D platformer, a game where the players moves throughout the level
            using some kind of gimmick with a special keybind</p>
           
    <h3>My Own Definition of Game</h3>
      <p>My definition of game is: "A digital or physical form of entertainment played with a ruleset</p>

            <li>47% Achiever<li>
            <li>27% Socialiser</li>
    <h3>My Fav Games</h3>
      <p>My top two favorite games are Persona 5 and the God of War franchise. Persona 5 is up there because the story, gameplay, and music. The entire God of War franchise
             is up here because of the twist the creators put on the greek mythology and pantheon. Other favorite games that I like for no specific reason are:
 <ul>
  <li>Minecraft</li>
  <li>Overwatch 2</li>
  <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
  <li>Elden Ring</li>   
  <li>Apex Legends</li>
</ul>
