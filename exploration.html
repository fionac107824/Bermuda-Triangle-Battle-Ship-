	 <h2 id="Initial">Intital Designs</h2>
	 <h3>Here are some of our intial ideas when starting are game designing process:</h3>
	 <ul>
		 <li>Forest Fire Pygame:</li>
		 <p>This game was supposed to be designed through the Pygame software. Originally, we wanted this to be based off of the Happy Garden game
		     in the coding games in python book. There a cow in a forest. Then fires are spreading everywhere. The cow is the person trying to put out the fire, 
		   basically like a firefighter.Then trees are placed everywhere and the cow has to stop the forest fire. Though we liked the idea, we realized
			that actually implementing the game would pose many difficulties as our game would be controlled by the cricket board.
			 We eventually realized that the complexity of the game's design would not be  plausible game idea.
		 <li>Animal Crossing Board Game:</li>
			 <p>This game was a board game that we designed tlizing small figurines of animals. There were four animals that were supposed to 
			get across to cross diagonally over the forest to their new home. Then, on the different blacks they would have colors indicating a teleportation. 
 
		 <li>Realistic Monopoly:</li>
			 <p>We originally wanted to make a game based off of monopoly. We wanted to give it more of a tech category by assigning one of the 
			big four tech companies from Apple,Samsung, Microsoft, and Google and then have each player play as that company. 
			Each time that a company goes to jail, they lose money. In the end, we realized that we could not attribute a greater significance to the game
			thus changing our idea. From this design, we learned that while game design is a creativeprocess, we also need a greater purpose for our game
				 to make it entertaining.</p>
	 </ul>
	
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 <h2 id="Clarification">Narrowing Down Our Design</h2>
	 <p> We narrowed down our design from our past designs.We knew that we wanted our game to be hands on as we thought it would be much more interactive. Thus, 
		Thus, we decided to create a board game. Then we though about the game "Battleship" and wanted to give a greater meaning to it by mixing in conspiracy theories
		 and misinformation whcih we were able accomplish through our use of the Bermuda Triangle. Our game embodied the characteristics that we wanted in a action filled game with h
		 hands on involvement while keeping the rules simplistic and not over complicated.
